Recruiting snowboarding Node.js developers ­can we talk?


[FName],

I was researching top Node developers in the Montreal area and came across your LinkedIn profile.
Ended up diving pretty deep into your Github and Twitter profiles too you look like a perfect fit for the direction we’re moving as a company, so I had to reach out.

Also, congrats on the snowboarding awards! I’m pretty sure you’d fit in with the rest of the team,­ 
we like to spend as much time on the mountain as possible…

Would you be open to having a quick chat?
