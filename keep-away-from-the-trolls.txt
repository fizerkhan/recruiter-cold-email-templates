Keep away from the trolls!

Hi [First Name],

“Keep your goals away from the trolls” – knew I had to reach out after I read this on your twitter. 
Might get this up as a motivational poster in the office! I have to know where you found it!

I saw that when you’re not fighting trolls you’re a killer sales rep! 
Awesome work helping your team nail its targets last quarter, you guys are growing insanely fast…

I thought I’d reach out because we’re building our sales team at [Company] and 
I think you’d be a great fit. Do you have some time next week for a quick call to talk about the role?

Best,
[Your Name]
