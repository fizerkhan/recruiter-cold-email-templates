My spirit animal is an owl, maybe it could be friends with your hawk?


[FName],

As you can see I’ve spent a little time on your blog recently! 
Loved your post on spirit animals and how they can influence the creative process…

We’re looking for a new designer to join our team ­ I think that you have a really interesting take on the design process and 
I’d love to discuss the role with you.

Do you have time to talk tomorrow afternoon?
